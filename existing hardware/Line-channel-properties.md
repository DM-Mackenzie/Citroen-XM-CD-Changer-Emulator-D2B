**Line Input Channel**

We want to match the existing line channel properties to ensure performance will not be compromised. the following needs to be known and applied:
1. Impedance of existing CD changer DAC (Ohm):   _Unknown, needs to be checked_
2. Sampling rate (KHz):  _Unknown, needs to be checked. Probably 44100 or 48000 Hz_
3. Peak to peak voltage:  _Unknown, needs to be checked._
