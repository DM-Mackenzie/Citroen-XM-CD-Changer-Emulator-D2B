**D2B frame explained**
A D2B (Domestic Digital Bus) frame is a structured data packet used for communication between devices on the D2B bus. The frame ensures reliable data transmission by encapsulating data and control information in a specific format. Here’s a breakdown of the components of a D2B frame:

Excerpt from MSM6307 datasheet

1. Start Bit
    Function: The start bit indicates the beginning of a new frame.
    Details: A device that wants to initiate communication checks if the bus is free and then places a low signal ('L') on the bus for a unique duration to signal the start of a new frame.

2. Mode Field
    Function: Specifies the speed mode and handles arbitration if multiple masters are present.
    Details: The mode field determines the transmission speed. During this field, arbitration takes place to resolve which master device gains control of the bus if there are multiple masters attempting to communicate.

3. Master Field
    Function: Identifies the master device initiating the frame.
    Details: This field contains the address of the master device and is followed by a parity bit for error checking. The address helps other devices recognize the source of the communication.

4. Slave Field
    Function: Specifies the target slave device.
    Details: The master sends the address of the intended slave device. This field ensures that only the targeted device processes the following data.

5. Control Field
    Function: Provides additional control information for the transaction.
    Details: This field is a 4-bit word that contains specific control instructions, followed by a parity bit and an acknowledgment bit from the slave. The control field defines the nature of the transmission (e.g., read, write, data type).

6. Data Field
    Function: Contains the actual data to be transmitted.
    Details: The data field includes the bytes being sent from the master to the slave or vice versa. Each byte is followed by an end-of-data bit, a parity bit for error checking, and an acknowledgment bit to confirm successful reception.

7. Parity Bits
    Function: Error detection.
    Details: Parity bits are added to various parts of the frame (master address, slave address, control bits, data bytes) to ensure data integrity. Odd parity is typically used, meaning the number of 1-bits in the group should be odd.

8. End-of-Data Bit
    Function: Indicates the end of a data byte.
    Details: After each data byte, this bit signifies whether the byte just transmitted is the last byte in the sequence.

9. Acknowledge Bits
    Function: Confirms successful reception.
    Details: After each significant segment (slave address, control bits, data bytes), an acknowledgment bit is sent. A positive acknowledgment (ACK) is represented by a '0', while a negative acknowledgment (NACK) is represented by a '1'.

**Example of a D2B Frame**
Let’s consider an example where a master device sends a command to a slave device to increment a track number:

    Start Bit: Initiates the frame.
    Mode Field: Sets the transmission speed.
    Master Field: Contains the address of the master device (unknown for now).
    Slave Field: Contains the address of the target slave device (unknown for now).
    Control Field: Specifies a write operation.
    Data Field: Contains the command 0x73 (increment track number; command taken from the IEC standard, must be verified)
    Parity Bits: Ensure data integrity for each segment.
    End-of-Data Bit: Indicates the end of the command byte.
    Acknowledge Bits: Sent by the slave to confirm receipt of each segment.

_Note that all data was taken from the MSM6307 datasheet and IEC standard. _
