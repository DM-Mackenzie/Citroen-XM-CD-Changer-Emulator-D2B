# D2B commands

D2B commands are predetermined and described in the IEC 61030 standard Annex A. These consist of the following properties:

- Operation Code with a code and attribute
- Operand with a code and attribute

Different categories are present: 
1. General commands (standby, etc)
2. Video commands (TV functionality, such as gamma, brightness)
3. Audio commands, including volume, bass, treble, balance, stereo, surround / Dolby
4. Deck/ Player commands, including repeat, precord, play, etc.
5. Tuner commands, including band, channel, frequency
6. Text function commands, including menu, page number, etc (some sort of teletext?)
7. Camera video commands, zoom, focus, etc.
8. Timer commands, including year, month, day, etc.

Although a CD changer is not present, it is probable that either in the Audio or Deck Player commands there are suitable commands to control our unit. For the sake of copyright, I cannot share the contents of the IEC standard without their permission.
