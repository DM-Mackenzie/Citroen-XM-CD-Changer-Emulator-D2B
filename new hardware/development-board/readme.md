**Development Board**

Prior to creating a final PCB (which should be a fun exercise) a development board will be created. The main goal is an easy to assemble board with easy connections. The following design principles should apply:
1. Easy to just plugin in components, such as an ESP32 dev board as a piggy back.
2. Springloaded socket to mount MSM6307 (so no chance of destroying components that are not being manufactured anymore)
3. Block connector for power
4. Ready made PCM5102A DAC board as a piggy back
5. PCB mount components should be through hole for easy soldering
6. Components used should match the final PCB components as close as possible.
